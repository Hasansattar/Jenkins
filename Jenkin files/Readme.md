### Sample Jenkins integration steps
1. check unit test
2. check code quality 
3. Now Build the code
4. Deploy code on testing environment
5. Deploy Code on staging environment
6. Deploy Code on Production environment

**unit test -> build -> deploy on test ->deploy on prod**


For this example we need  2 machines one is for production server and and one is for test server , like 

jenkins -> 192.168.0.106 (ubuntu)
testserver -> 192.168.0.122 (ubuntu)
